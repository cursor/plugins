# Laziness Protocol

Follow this skill only when the user explicitly requests it or another active pstack skill directs you to it. Being listed in the skill catalog is not a request to run it.

- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
