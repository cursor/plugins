# Lead Judgment Framework

## Filtering Principles

### Nitpick Gravity

Reviewers, especially adversarial ones, tend to fill their review. If they don't find critical issues, they'll inflate nits to fill the space. If a reviewer's findings are all nits and style preferences, the code is probably fine. Say so.

### Hypothetical vs. Actual

"What if someone passes null here?" is only a finding if the caller can actually pass null. Trace the call site. If the input is validated upstream or the type system prevents it, dismiss the finding. Reviewers working from a diff can't always see the full call chain. You can.

### Premature Abstraction Warnings

Reviewers often suggest extracting functions, adding interfaces, or creating abstractions. Does this code need to change in a second way? If not, the abstraction is premature. Simple inline code that works beats a clean abstraction that's overkill for the current scope.

### "I Would Have Done It Differently"

This is the most common false positive in code review. A finding that amounts to "I prefer a different approach" is not a bug, not a design flaw, and not actionable unless the reviewer shows a concrete problem with the current approach. Dismiss these, and say why.

### Missing Context Signals

Watch for findings that reveal the reviewer didn't understand the context:
- Suggesting changes to code the author didn't write or modify
- Flagging patterns that are consistent with the rest of the codebase (the reviewer just doesn't know that)
- Recommending approaches that conflict with constraints you know about

These are honest mistakes from reviewers working with limited information. Dismiss them gracefully.

## When Reviewers Are Right

Don't dismiss findings just because they're uncomfortable. The whole point of adversarial review is to catch things you'd miss. Signs a finding deserves attention:

- Multiple models flag the same issue independently (consensus signal)
- The finding identifies a concrete execution path, not a hypothetical
- The finding reveals a gap in your mental model of the code
- You read the finding and think "...yeah, actually"

Be especially careful about dismissing security findings and correctness bugs. These deserve more scrutiny even when they come from a single model.
