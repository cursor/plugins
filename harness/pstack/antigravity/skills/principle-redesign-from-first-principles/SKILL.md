# Redesign From First Principles

Follow this skill only when the user explicitly requests it or another active pstack skill directs you to it. Being listed in the skill catalog is not a request to run it.

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from the start.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference: types, docs, examples, rationale sections
- Think about the whole redesign, then deliver it incrementally

This is the method for preserving option value when integrating changes into an existing design.
