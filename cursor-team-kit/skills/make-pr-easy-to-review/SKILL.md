# Make PR Easy to Review

Prepare a PR so a reviewer can quickly understand the intent, important files, and risk. The default goal is reviewability without behavior changes.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target PR from the user-provided URL or current branch.
2. Inspect commits, diff size, changed paths, generated files, and PR description.
3. Identify reviewability issues: noisy commits, stale description, unrelated changes, mixed mechanical and logic changes, missing tests, or unclear reviewer entry points.
4. Propose a plan before rewriting history or force-pushing.
5. Apply safe improvements, then verify the tree or diff still matches the intended code.

## History Cleanup

Only rewrite history when the user asks for it or agrees to the plan. Before rewriting:

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --json title,headRefName,baseRefName,state,commits
# pull/<PR>/head exists for same-repo and fork PRs. The head branch
# name often does not exist on origin when the PR comes from a fork.
git fetch origin "refs/pull/<PR>/head"
ORIGINAL_TREE=$(git rev-parse "FETCH_HEAD^{tree}")
```

Good commit groupings usually follow dependency order:

1. Schema/storage or generated API definitions.
2. Core logic.
3. Wiring and integration.
4. UI or surface behavior.
5. Tests.

After rewriting, verify content identity:

```bash
echo "Original tree: $ORIGINAL_TREE"
echo "Current tree:  $(git rev-parse "HEAD^{tree}")"
git diff "$ORIGINAL_TREE" "HEAD^{tree}" --stat
```

Do not push if the tree changed unintentionally.

## Reviewer Guidance

When code behavior should stay untouched, prefer PR description and review notes:

- Add a TL;DR that matches the actual diff.
- Separate core files from generated or mechanical files.
- Call out risky behavior changes, migration order, rollout plan, and test coverage.
- Link issue trackers, dashboards, or design docs when they explain intent.

## Guardrails

- Never hide meaningful behavior changes inside "cleanup".
- Do not bypass hooks unless the user explicitly asks.
- If the PR is too large to make reviewable with notes, recommend splitting instead of polishing around the problem.
