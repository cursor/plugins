# Cursor plugins

Official Cursor plugins for popular developer tools, frameworks, and SaaS products. Each plugin is a standalone directory with its own `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. First-party plugins live at the repository root; third-party integrations live under `third-party/`.

## Repository structure

This is a multi-plugin marketplace repository. The root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins, and each plugin has its own manifest:
