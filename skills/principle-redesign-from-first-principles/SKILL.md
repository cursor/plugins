## Host binding for this installation

Before executing this skill, resolve its actual installed location and the calling project. Read the compatible installed `pstack-host/HOST.md` and run its preflight as described there with this skill directory. Project copies take precedence over global copies. If pstack-host is missing, stop and show a supplement command selecting pstack-host from the repository recorded in this skill’s `pstack-source.json`. The host binding overrides Cursor-only tools, model slugs and plugin paths below; retain the full task and workflow instructions. Never write project state into this installed directory.

# Redesign From First Principles

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from the start.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference: types, docs, examples, rationale sections
- Think about the whole redesign, then deliver it incrementally

This is the method for preserving option value when integrating changes into an existing design.
