# benny automation intent

## what i want to automate

i want two host workflows that work together in one slack issue channel.

### automation 1: triage issue reports

- trigger: when someone posts a new top-level report in my configured source slack channel, i want this automation to start on that report and keep its original thread coordinates.
- behavior: i want it to read the thread and attachments, classify the report as a bug or performance issue, feature request, question or feedback, or reroute, and trace the likely owning layer before routing.
- tracker: i want it to search my configured tracker for duplicates, update a confident duplicate, and create a ticket only for a clear net-new bug.
- tools: i want slack thread read and reply access, my configured tracker integration, and my optional routing map.
- outcome: i want exactly one reply in the source thread with a short verdict and `[benny:bug]`, `[benny:performance]`, or `[benny:other]`. a bug or performance marker may include the tracker url.
- boundary: i never want this automation to post a root message in the source channel.

### automation 2: reproduce and fix confirmed bugs

- trigger: i want this automation to start from the same new top-level report, or another supported trigger chosen during setup, then wait for the trusted triage marker in the original thread.
- gates: i want it to stop when someone clearly owns the fix. if an existing pull request or merged commit may fix the report, i want verification instead of a competing change.
- behavior: i want it to use my configured control adapter and feature map, reproduce the exact symptom twice through the real ui, and capture screenshots, video, and a read-only state cross-check.
- fix: i want it to verify existing pull requests without authoring over them. after a confirmed repro, it may attempt one bounded root-cause fix, use tdd when the test is cheap, smoke the blast radius, and open a draft pull request only when before-and-after proof passes.
- tools: i want slack thread read and reply access, repository and history access, draft pull request creation, my configured tracker, and my control adapter.
- outcome: i want evidence and a verified result in the source or optional operations threads, plus an optional draft pull request. updates should be concise.
- boundary: i never want this automation to post a root message in the source channel.

### shared rules

- i want the source channel and root thread coordinates to stay immutable for the whole run.
- i treat utility and debug bots as evidence, not delegation or fix ownership.
- i allow subagents to help, but they cannot post to slack or receive slack credentials.
- i want this entire pack committed at `.pstack/benny/` in the target repository. its `instruction.md` files are direct automation instructions, not registered plugin skills.
- i want pstack installed in the target project's skill directory only for shared dependencies such as `how`, `why`, `tdd`, `unslop`, and the required principle skills.
- i want each live automation prompt to read its committed operational file directly. i do not want plugin cache paths, copied excerpts, or slash-skill discovery.
- i keep user-owned configuration, feature maps, routing maps, and secrets outside `.pstack/benny/` so pack refreshes cannot overwrite them.
- i want both automations to fail closed when channel coordinates, tracker access, the control adapter, or the feature map are missing or uncertain.
- i want draft pull requests only. do not merge or deploy.

### my configuration

- source slack channel: `<channel>`
- optional operations channel: `<channel or none>`
- repository and default branch: `<repo>`, `<branch>`
- tracker: `<type, team, project, labels, intake status>`
- routing map: `<path or none>`
- triage identity: `<slack identity>`
- control skill: `<configured skill or adapter>`
- feature map: `<committed same-repo path outside the copied pack, or behavior to paraphrase>`
- models: `<triage, reproduce, code, media review>`
- status emoji strings: `<seen, reproducing, reproduced, blocked, fixing, failed, pull request opened>`
- budgets: `<polling, verdict wait, follow-up, repro, rejection, fix>`
- optional bot token capability: `<none, file download, or editable operations status>`

start from [`configuration.example.yaml`](./templates/configuration.example.yaml) and [`feature-map.example.md`](./skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md). copy and fill them outside this pack, for example under `.pstack/benny-user/`. keep secret values in a secret manager or environment.

## for the agent

the human enters setup by pointing the host at this file. do not look for or invoke a discovered benny slash skill.

1. ask which repository will run the automations.
2. treat the directory containing this `FOR_AGENTS.md` as the source pack.
3. merge the entire source pack into `<target-repository>/.pstack/benny/`.
4. preserve every destination-only file. never delete unrelated files or overwrite user-owned configuration, feature maps, or routing maps.
5. when an existing destination file at a source-managed path differs, review the diff and merge without discarding local edits. if ownership is ambiguous, stop and ask before replacing it.
6. verify that the copied `FOR_AGENTS.md` and `skills/setup-benny/instruction.md` exist in the target repository.
7. read and follow `.pstack/benny/skills/setup-benny/instruction.md` directly from the target repository.

Use project-scoped skills installed with `npx skills add`; do not modify Cursor settings. Verify from a fresh session rooted in the target repository that `how`, `why`, `tdd`, `unslop` and every principle named in the setup file resolve from project scope. The pack contains instruction.md files, never discoverable slash skills.

Use the copied setup instruction and DEPLOYMENT.md. Commit the pack and secret-free user configuration before scheduling. Never enable either workflow until the user requests it and the thread-safety checks pass. Codex and Claude Code scheduler capability is separate from Slack/tracker/control capability. If those tools are absent, refuse external execution; the bundled runner can only verify simulated events without an adapter.
