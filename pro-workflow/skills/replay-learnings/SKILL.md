# Replay Learnings

Find and surface relevant learnings from past sessions before you start working.

## Trigger

Use when starting a new task, saying "what do I know about", or "before I start".

## Workflow

1. Extract keywords from the task description.
2. Search for matching patterns in learnings and session history.
3. Check correction history for similar file patterns.
4. Surface top learnings ranked by relevance.

## Output

```
REPLAY BRIEFING: <task>

Past learnings (ranked by relevance):
  1. [Category] Rule text (applied Nx)
     Mistake: What went wrong previously

Suggested approach:
  - What to watch out for based on past learnings
```
