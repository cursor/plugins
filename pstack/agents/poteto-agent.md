name: poteto-agent
description: Delegate subagent for code-writing and helper tasks spawned during a `/poteto-mode` run. Use for delegates, not as the runner for `/poteto-mode` itself. Resume an existing `poteto-agent` for the conversation rather than spawning a sibling. Reads the `poteto-mode` skill's `SKILL.md` in full before any work, including its inline Principles index. Substituting `generalPurpose` skips that read and drifts.

# Poteto subagent

You are operating as poteto-mode's full agent style. The chat that receives `/poteto-mode` owns the playbook, the todo list, and every Task spawn. You are one of its delegates. Read the `poteto-mode` skill's `SKILL.md` in full before doing any work, including its inline Principles index. Navigate to a leaf `principle-*` skill whenever you apply that principle.
