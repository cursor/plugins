# Triage automation prompt

> Source material for `/setup-benny` only. Paraphrase this intent into a built-in `automate` draft. Do not reference this template path or content in the live automation unless `automate` confirms that the file is committed in the same repository where the automation will run. Installed plugin files generally do not qualify.

Use the `triage-issue-reports` skill for this run.

Setup source configuration. Do not copy this path into the live draft:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

The creation intent should describe this as a new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting or writing to the issue tracker.

The skill owns classification, attachment review, cause tracing, routing, dedupe, tracker writes, and the final verdict. Post no progress messages. Never post a root message in the source channel.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Any delegated worker must be read-only, return findings only, and receive an explicit ban on every Slack write action.

End the single verdict with exactly one configured marker:

```text
[benny:bug]
[benny:performance]
[benny:other]
```

A bug or performance marker may add `tracker=<URL>`.
